## The largest mental health database in Minnesota.
Inspired by RCI's (https://www.rcimentalhealth.org/) approach. However, this uses scale. This employs parsing, scraping, data science, and machine learning to find all possible mental health physical locations in Minnesota. This method can be employed to resources across the United States, however, I do not posess the computing power. Will update this readme if I have todo lists for any or all. 

## Frontend 
Basic NextJS frontend. Filtering, etc. 

## Backend 
Python. Still working on it and will publish soon.
