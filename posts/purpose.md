## Our Roots
There are so many 501(c)(3)'s - let alone non-profit organizations - in the world. All of them doing incredible things. 

Rochester Asian American Organization (RAAO) started as a small high school club with around 35 members, aiming to educate students about Asian culture and address the negative stigma towards minority groups, particularly the AAPI community. We hosted Mayo High School's first Holi celebration, which attracted over 50 participants, and organized other cultural events. As we grew, we established RAAO chapters in other schools across the county.

Darian, the co-founder, and I wanted to expand further. We partnered with the City of Rochester and the University of Minnesota to direct LinkBRT, a proposed 2.3-mile transit route in Rochester, MN, focusing on diversity. We also created RAAO Stories, interviewing local businesses to highlight family-owned and AAPI businesses and document the unique challenges faced by small business owners.

However, we realized that there were only two of us, and making a significant impact is challenging for just two high schoolers. Unlike larger organizations like Feeding America, the Red Cross, and Habitat for Humanity, which have extensive resources and reach, our capacity was limited. Nonetheless, our dedication and efforts laid a strong foundation for future growth and impact.

## Our New Ideas and Technical Focus

Recently, we have shifted RAAOâ€™s focus towards technology.

I've been passionate about computer science for a long time. Whether it's developing computer vision AI applications, reverse engineering Google's ReCAPTCHA algorithms, or building toolkits to generate practice tests for Chemistry, I love to apply technology wherever possible.

I wanted to bring this passion to RAAO. By integrating my technical skills with our mission, I realized we could broaden our impact and support communities that often go unnoticed or lack resources. This transformation allows us to create innovative solutions and provide more substantial support to smaller communities that deserve more recognition and assistance.

We envision using technology to bridge gaps in education, mental health, and community engagement. For instance, we are developing [**Ethan**](/posts/ethan), an AI-powered mental health support application designed to offer immediate assistance to those in need. Additionally, we are working on educational tools that can help students from underrepresented backgrounds excel in STEM fields.

We want to work with existing organizations whos missions align with our own to further our goals. We are building the [largest mental health database in the midwest](/providers) -- backed by [Rochester Community Initiative's](https://www.rochinitiative.org/) survey data -- to deliver resources to communities that need it. We'd love to partner with other organizations, so please, don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:ajaymisra1@outlook.com).

Our goal is to use technology to empower and uplift marginalized communities, ensuring they have access to the same opportunities and resources as larger, more recognized groups. By doing so, we aim to create a more inclusive and supportive environment for everyone.

Despite still being a small 501(c)(3), we aim to use technology to apply to larger groups of people while still providing dedicated support to those who need.
